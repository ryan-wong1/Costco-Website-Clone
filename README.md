This project is a clone/replica of https://www.costco.com/employee-website.html and was created using HTML and CSS. No JavaScript (yet).

Site is fully responsive. Will jump to mobile display at 600px using media queries. For source code for responsive display, please look at 'media_costco.css'.

Project was originally 'completed' sometime in May of 2021 but was revamped a few months later (time of writing this) with cleaner code (mainly renaming many classes to more relevant and specific titles). 

Also please note that if official page looks different compared to my replica at the time of viewing, please note that Costco occasionally pushes new updates to the official page. Replica was intended to be that of the exact design of the official page at the time of original creation.

*Will have plans of later adding the JavaScript to make this page interactive. All functionalities will be as what already exists on the official page (again, see link above). 

*Also might be cool to recreate https://www.costco.com/ (the main site) with responsiveness and JavaScript interactivity just for fun. Will see how I feel.

EDIT: Added some JavaScript (please see 'costco.js'). Dropdown information appears/dissapears upon clicking on '+/-' symbols at the footer for mobile display. Hovering over some items in the navigation bar now reveals a non-modal form that reappears/dissapears upon hovering on/off. Not all modal forms are completed (especially for the 'Shop All Departments' dropdown menu) but the approach/logic behind creation would essentially be the same as what i've already created so far.
